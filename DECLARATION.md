## Global AI Acceptance Index -- Open Research Foundation

This project is open to institutions, databases, AI platforms, and researchers worldwide for continued deep investigation into cross-national differences in artificial intelligence acceptance. We welcome collaboration from academic departments, policy research organizations, and industry stakeholders seeking to understand the social dimensions of AI adoption.

## Research Purpose

The Global AI Acceptance Index compiles data from 46 sources across 121 countries to measure public attitudes toward artificial intelligence. The dataset integrates nationally representative surveys (Pew Research Center, Ipsos, Edelman), government readiness indices (Oxford Insights, Stanford HAI, ITU), and enterprise adoption reports (McKinsey, Microsoft, IBM) into a single weighted composite score per country.

The primary research question driving this project concerns the **relationship between a nation's technological capacity and its population's willingness to accept AI** -- a relationship that, contrary to intuition, is often inverted. Understanding where and why this inversion occurs is essential for evidence-based AI governance and for identifying the conditions under which public trust can develop alongside technological progress.

## The United States Paradox

Among the most striking findings in the dataset is the position of the United States. Despite leading the world in nearly every measure of AI capability and infrastructure -- including $109.1 billion in private AI investment in 2024, a high-tech adoption score of 90/100, and top-tier government AI readiness rankings -- the US registers an AI acceptance score of just **36 out of 100**, based on five independent data sources rated at high confidence.

For context:

| Country | AI Acceptance | High-Tech Adoption | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| China | 82 | 64 | High (8 sources) |
| South Korea | 75 | 61 | High |
| India | 68 | 43 | High |
| Japan | 45 | 55 | High |
| Germany | 44 | 70 | High |
| **United States** | **36** | **90** | **High (5 sources)** |

The US acceptance score is derived from:

- **Pew Research Center (2025):** 38% of Americans report being more excited than concerned about increased AI use in daily life (online panel, N=3,605, nationally representative).
- **Ipsos AI Monitor (2024):** 34% express excitement about AI-powered products and services; 39% agree that AI products have more benefits than drawbacks (N=1,000).
- **Edelman Trust Barometer (2025):** 32% trust AI overall (N=1,000).
- **Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll (2021):** 32% believe AI will mostly help people (N=1,000; historical baseline, pre-ChatGPT era, weighted accordingly).

This gap between technological leadership and public receptivity is not merely a polling curiosity. It has direct implications for:

- **AI policy effectiveness** -- Regulations and national AI strategies risk misalignment if public sentiment diverges sharply from institutional assumptions about technology readiness.
- **Workforce transition** -- Low acceptance may slow adoption in sectors where AI integration could improve productivity, creating a lag between available technology and realized economic benefit.
- **International competitiveness** -- Nations with both high capability and high acceptance (e.g., China at 82/64, South Korea at 75/61) may realize compounding advantages as public engagement accelerates innovation cycles.
- **Public trust infrastructure** -- Understanding the drivers of low acceptance is a prerequisite for developing trust frameworks that are informed by empirical evidence rather than assumptions.

## Future Research Directions

This dataset provides a quantitative foundation, but the US acceptance gap warrants deeper investigation across several dimensions:

1. **Media framing analysis** -- How do US media narratives around AI differ from those in high-acceptance countries? What role do framing effects (risk-centric vs. benefit-centric coverage) play in shaping public attitudes?

2. **Regulatory environment** -- Does the structure of AI governance (centralized vs. fragmented, prescriptive vs. principles-based) correlate with public trust levels? The US regulatory landscape is notably decentralized compared to the EU or China.

3. **Education and AI literacy** -- To what extent does formal exposure to AI concepts in secondary and post-secondary education predict acceptance? How do workforce retraining programs affect attitudes among populations most exposed to automation risk?

4. **Cultural and institutional trust** -- The US exhibits declining institutional trust across multiple domains (Edelman, 2025). Is AI skepticism a domain-specific phenomenon or a downstream effect of broader trust erosion?

5. **Demographic disaggregation** -- The composite national score masks variation by age, income, education, geography, and industry. Identifying which subpopulations drive the US average downward is essential for targeted interventions.

6. **Longitudinal tracking** -- The inclusion of the 2021 World Risk Poll baseline (pre-ChatGPT) alongside 2024-2025 data suggests that US acceptance may have declined or stagnated even as AI capabilities advanced rapidly. Continued measurement will clarify whether this is a durable trend or a transient response to a period of rapid change.
